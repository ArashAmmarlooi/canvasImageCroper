Hi , 
Firstable Appreciate so much for sending the sample project challenge .
It was a pleasure to having me in this code test . 
I have got the project and chnaged some of the contents of the code it was my bad to to interfere with your code and changing the webpack config and also make some changes in hole project . ( please accept my apology ).

The worked that I have done is below please . 

1 - Webpack  and pakcgae.json configure as well a changing some contents for Handling react and sass . Also make the project to be able to handle production mode and development mode . 
2 - Config react and use this framework and make three components for getting and importing the files .
3 - Make a bable file for converting jsx to readble ES6 javascript .
4 - Makesome modals for previewing the image First modal is for croping . I could make roation today or tomorow But I have done the scaling of the canvas.
5 - Add sliders to get the values and resize image of the canvas to modals.
6 - Made a second modal for reviewng the saved photo . 
7 - Change main.js content for putting all javascrit project functions in order to add functionalities to the project . And also add index.js for bundle of hole project react js files .
8 - Add git hub pages config to packge.json and set home page and the link is below

(Just desktop version)

9 - I didn`t style the project for mobile responsive design but in complete project I will do the responsive config completly my self . In this project I just wanted to show you how i code . 

NOTICE : Unfortunately I had two busy days since Monday and I started the project on Wednesday  , but Due to lack of time I wanted to send the project before holiday (Saturday , Sunday). I have wrote as many code as I could but if I had two days more I would add tests and exact canvas positioning and more and more ,  but I push this code in the Github repository today . But if I cooperate with the team I would learn the exact adjustment of canvas and go with the rules  of Albeli company (I know the canvas frontend and backend methods very well ), but now actually I don`t know the specific units and positions of the canvases and images and print rules in Albeli but I wanted to show point . And also I learn and cooperate fast with the team . 

Thanks again to give me this honor .
Regards .
Arash Ammarlooi .
