Hi , 
Firstable Appreciate so much for sending the sample project challenge .
It was a pleasure to having me in this code test . 
I have got the project and chnaged some of the contents of the code it was my bad to to interfere with your code and changing the webpack config and also make some changes in hole project . ( please accept my apology ).

The worked that I have done is below please . 

1 - Made webpack and package.json configuration as well changing some contents for Handling react and sass . Also make the project to be able to handle production mode and development mode . 
2 - Config react and use this framework and make three components for getting and importing the files .
3 - Make a bable file for converting jsx to readble ES6 javascript .
4 - Made some modals for previewing the image First modal is for croping . I could make roation But I have just done the scaling and x , y postioning of the canvas.
5 - Add sliders to get the values and resize image of the canvas to modals.
6 - Made a second modal for reviewng the saved photo . 
7 - Set crop area height of canvas based on the aspcet ratio and height of the image canvas . 
8 - Change main.js content for putting all javascrit project functions in order to add functionalities to the project . And also add index.js for bundle of hole project react js files .
9 - make changePos function which gets onClick event and call change Pos function to increase or decrease x positions of the image.
NOTICE : I could change position of y or maybe change postion of the image with mouse movement but for the lack of time I just handle the button clicks for x position with the help of arrow buttons for changing x and y postions . 
10 - Add git hub pages config to packge.json and set home page and the link is below

(Just desktop version)

11 - I didn`t style the project for mobile responsive design but in complete project I will do the responsive config completly my self . In this project I just wanted to show you the point . 

NOTICE : I have wrote as many code as I could but if I had more time I would add tests and other methods . 
If I cooperate with the team I would learn the exact adjustment of canvas measurements and go with the rules of Albeli company ( I know the canvas , frontend and backend methods very well ) but now actually I don`t know the specific units and positions of the canvas , images measurements and printing configuration in Albeli ,  And because of that I just use ordinary units in order to show how I write the code and whats is my approach as well as solving the problems . 
Also I will learn fast and cooperate quickly with the team . 

Thanks again for giving me this honor .

Regards .
Arash Ammarlooi .
