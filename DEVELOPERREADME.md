NOTICE : Unfortunatly I had two busy days since monday and I started the project on wednesday  , but Due to lack of time I wanted to send the project before holiday (stuarday , sunday). I have wrote as many code as I could but if I had two days more I would add tests and exatc canvas positioning and more and more ,  but I push this code in the github repository today . But if I cooporate with the team I would learn the exact adjustment of canvas and go with the rules  of albeli company (I know the canvas very well ), but now actually I dont know the specific units and postions of the canvases and images and princt rules in albeli but I wanted to show point . 

Thanks again to give me this honor .
Regards .
Arash Ammarlooi .
